Barryâ€™s Adventure is a 2D platformer game that has 3 levels. The features of the game include, hunting a hidden treasure, avoiding obstacles and enemies, and collecting points and lives. The player must avoid obstacles and enemies and collect all gold crystals to get to the next level. Collecting coins gain extra points, while collecting heart crystals give an extra life.

Use Left, Right or A, D to move character to left or right
Use Spacebar to jump
This 2D platformer is centered on Barry the treasure hunting dog and as such, many of the game's mechanics revolve around him. The basic mechanic of movement is done through using the arrow keys to move Barry. The left arrow key moves Barry to the left, the right arrow key moves him to the right. The Spacebar key is used to make Barry jump, this is used to help him traverse through the terrain and levels of the game. Since the mechanic of jumping is involved, so is the mechanic of gravity. The movement mechanics will all be implemented using 2D physics. Some of the game's mechanics apart from Barry, would be the instant death that is caused by bottomless pits. As well as the giant spike enemies that will lower Barry's life. This game has levels and upon completion of the final level, the game is finished.
